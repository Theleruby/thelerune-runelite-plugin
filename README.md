# TheleRune Updater
This is a RuneLite plugin which automatically sends an API update request to TheleRune (rune.theleruby.com) when you log out. You need the API key in order for the update request to actually work. You can optionally choose how much experience must have been earned before sending the request.

This is probably of no use to anyone except me (and maybe my immediate friends, if I can persuade them to play OSRS with me at some point).
